# Ngrok Setup Instructions

This document provides step-by-step instructions for deploying the Streamlit UI using Ngrok to make it publicly accessible.

## Prerequisites

* Ngrok Account: Sign up for a free account at [ngrok.com](https://ngrok.com/).
* Ngrok Authtoken: Obtain your authtoken from the Ngrok dashboard after signing up.

## Steps

1.  Install Ngrok Library: Ensure you have the Ngrok library installed in your project's environment. This should be handled by your `requirements.txt` file, but you can install it manually if needed.

    pip install pyngrok

2.  Authenticate Ngrok: Add your authtoken to your system. This only needs to be done once. Replace `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` with the token from your dashboard.

    ngrok authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>

3.  Run Streamlit App: Start your Streamlit application from the `ui/` directory.

    streamlit run ui/app.py

4.  Forward Traffic with Ngrok: Open a new terminal and run Ngrok to forward traffic to the port that Streamlit is running on (usually `8501`).

    ngrok http 8501

5.  Access the Public URL: Ngrok will provide a public URL (e.g., `https://<random-id>.ngrok-free.app`). Share this URL with others to give them live access to your Streamlit application.

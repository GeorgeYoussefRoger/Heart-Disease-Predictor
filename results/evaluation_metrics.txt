Conclusion:
1. Logistic Regression performed best overall, with the highest AUC and solid improvements after tuning making it the best model.
2. SVM also achieved a strong AUC and improved significantly after tuning making it a good secondary candidate.
3. Random Forest showed moderate performance.
4. Decision Tree performed poorly and is not suitable for deployment.
